        "## Introduction\n",
        "With the advent of quantum computing, traditional encryption algorithms such as RSA and ECC are at risk of being broken using quantum algorithms like Shor’s algorithm. To future-proof sensitive data, Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) offers cryptographic schemes that remain secure against quantum attacks. One such approach is Lattice-Based Cryptography, particularly Ring Learning With Errors (Ring-LWE), which provides robust security and efficiency.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Objective\n",
        "The objective of this project is to develop a secure file encryption tool leveraging Ring-LWE encryption, ensuring resistance against both classical and quantum attacks. The system will:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Generate Post-Quantum Keys using the Ring-LWE problem.\n",
        "- Encrypt Files Securely by computing a shared secret using the generated keys.\n",
        "- Decrypt Files Correctly by reconstructing the shared secret and recovering the original data.\n",
        "- Enable Secure Key Management for safe storage and retrieval of encryption keys.\n",
        "\n",
        "This project serves as a real-world implementation of post-quantum cryptographic techniques, contributing to research in quantum-resistant encryption. It can be extended to develop secure cloud storage solutions, encrypted messaging applications, or quantum-safe communication protocols.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Future Scope\n",
        "- Integration with Digital Signatures to verify data integrity and authenticity.\n",
        "- Implementation of Key Exchange Protocols for secure multi-user communication.\n",
        "- Optimizations for Performance to handle large files efficiently."

Classical cryptographic schemes like RSA, ECC, and Diffie-Hellman rely on mathematical problems (such as integer factorization and discrete logarithms) that can be efficiently solved using quantum algorithms like Shor’s Algorithm. To ensure long-term security, researchers are developing new encryption methods based on problems that even quantum computers cannot easily solve."

It is based on the hardness of problems related to lattices, which are grid-like mathematical structures in multidimensional space. The difficulty of solving problems like the Shortest Vector Problem (SVP) and the Learning With Errors (LWE) problem makes lattice-based cryptography highly resistant to attacks, even from quantum computers.\n",
